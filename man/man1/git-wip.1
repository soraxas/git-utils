.SH SYNOPSIS
.B git
\fI\,wip \/\fR[\fI\,BRANCH\/\fR] [\fI\,-c|--create\/\fR] [\fI\,-r|--revert\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a revertible wip commit
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-create\fR
enforce to create a wip commit, rather than the default
behaviour of intelligently create/revert without user input.
This flag has no effect if BRANCH is given, as it will always
be creating a wip commit before switching branch, and always
reverting a wip commit afterwards.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-revert\fR
enforce to revert a wip commit, otherwise same as above
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.SS "Quick summary:"
.IP
If there is a wip commit, it will revert it.
Otherwise, it will put dirty state into a wip commit.
If \fB\-\-create\fR or \fB\-\-revert\fR is given, it will not try to intelligently make
this decision for the user. The two flags are mutually exclusive.
.PP
Wip stands for work\-in\-progress. When executed, this script will first
check if there exists a wip commit in git log. If it does, it will revert
the commit and put the repo back into previous dirty state. This is
achieved by checking for a wip token in commit message.
.PP
It also takes special care on staged file and revert them in a staged
status accordingly.
.SS "[BRANCH]:"
.IP
If given, it will switch to BRANCH after wip action was
executed successfully.
In addition, it will reverts wip commit if there exists a wip commit in
the target branch.
